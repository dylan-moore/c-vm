Simple virtual machine (C version) by Dylan Moore - 23/10/18

My 17th birthday was yesterday, this is my reverse gift.
The virtual machine has 8 general purpose registers (0-7)
I will probably use this in a interpreter at one point.

You can share adaptations of this work if you give credit,
you cannot use this code in a commercial application.

Code compiles and runs fine on VS (2013) and TCC v0.9.27 (Windows 7 x64)
(I'd assume other compilers, especially GCC work fine also)

I have wrote a example program, you can find it in the main procedure.
It prints out however many terms the fibonacci sequence that you pick.
